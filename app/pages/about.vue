          <span class="font-bold text-slate-900">Salary transparency is broken.</span>
          Most people rely on awkward conversations with colleagues or outdated reports to know what
          they are worth.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built <span class="font-bold text-indigo-600">Am I Underpaid?</span> to change that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is simple: to give every employee the data they need to negotiate with
          confidence. We believe that when salary data is open and accessible, the pay gap closes
          and everyone wins.
